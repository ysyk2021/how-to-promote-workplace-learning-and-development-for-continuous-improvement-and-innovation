* **Training for Internal Coaches**: Provide training to managers and leaders on effective coaching techniques to equip them with the necessary skills to support their team members' career growth through coaching conversations.

* **Creating Peer Coaching Networks**: Facilitate the creation of peer coaching networks where employees can voluntarily provide coaching support to one another. This promotes knowledge-sharing, diverse perspectives, and a collaborative learning environment.

Emphasizing Continuous Feedback and Growth
